This is an ASP.Net Core MVC Web Application project. To keep away from using same or similar passwords(such as birthdays and keyboard patterns) on many websites, creating strong random passwords are best option since 
passwords are the first and front line of defense to protect against hacking attacks. This application is totally made to generate passwords of given length with alphabets upper and lower case, numerics and special characters. 

Stay safe online!
